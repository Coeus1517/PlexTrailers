How To!

Download and install Python V3 minimum.

https://www.python.org/downloads/

Download the .py files in this git.
Edit the py file with Notepad to make sure your Directory is set properly. The default is C:\Videos which if it does not exist it will create.

From there you'll need to open the python console and cd to the directory you have stored your DownloadXTrailers.py file to. 
I suggest storing files in C:\Tools\ as I have stored yt-dlp and chromedriver.exe there.



From here you will run py DownloadNewTrailer.py or py DownloadReleaseTrailer.py

The script will then check to see if you have the correct modules installed for use(Listed below).

Selenium(Web Scraper)
FFmpeg(Video/Audio Processing)
yt-dlp(Command Line youtube downloader)
requests(HTTP request module)
ChromeDriver(Backend Chrome Browser)
beautifulsoup4(HTML Parser)

These are all required for the individual functions of the script. Error logging should notify you if one fails to install.

It will then scrape the associated site. In this case I have designated https://www.themoviebox.net/s/trailer-round-up. 

Depending on the script you run it will either look for the most recent Trailer Round Up or Whats Coming Out This Week.

Once it finds it it will scrape that page, find all the embeded youtube links, and then download them. The default preset configuration is 1080p.
This can be configured by editting the yt-dlp section of the script towards the end.
